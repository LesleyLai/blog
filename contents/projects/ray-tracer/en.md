This is a toy [ray tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) for the Edx's [Computer Graphics](https://www.edx.org/course/computer-graphics-uc-san-diegox-cse167x-3) Course. It is my first large scale personal coding project. It parses an ad-hoc scene description text format and then performs recursive ray-tracing. The ray tracer handles ray-sphere and ray-triangle intersection but is slow on large scenes because it does not implement any acceleration structures.
