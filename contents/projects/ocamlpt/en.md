**Ocamlpt** is a path tracer live-coded in [Youtube stream](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlw1FcLpWd42vMLPlR3K7iq-CuCtkZr8o).
The path tracer is based on [Peter Shirley](http://psgraphics.blogspot.com/)'s fantastic book series "[Ray Tracing in a Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io)."
Some challenges I met include the poor support for graphics programming in the OCaml ecosystem and the inability of operator overloading in OCaml.
