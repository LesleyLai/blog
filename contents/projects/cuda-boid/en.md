This project is a CUDA implementation of [Boid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), an artificial life program that simulates fishes or birds' flocking behaviors. Besides the naive brute-force implementation, the project also implements grid accelerating data-structure. The simulation is visualized by OpenGL.
