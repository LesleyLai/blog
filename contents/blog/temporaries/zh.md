A lot of operations of C++ require temporary values. Using them before their destruction is imperative. However, not all C++ programmers I met have a solid understanding of when a temporary expire. This situation often leads to over-conservative estimations, which will not cause any harm. Nevertheless, sometimes it will cause programmers to assume guarantees that the language does not provide, which leads to insidious bugs.

<!-- end -->

One of the common scenarios such problem manifest is when we manipulate a string with `std::string`, but feed the result string back to an API that takes `const char*`. Consider the following code snippet:

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] auto greet(const std::string& name) -> std::string {
    return "Hello, " + name + '!';
}

int main() {
  const std::string name{"Lesley Lai"};
  std::puts(greet(name).c_str()); // highlight-line
}
```

The C++ Standard guarantees it to work. The Standard mandates that all temporary objects get destroyed as the last step of evaluating of the **full-expression** that contains the point where the temporaries were created[^1]. "full expression" means an expression that is not sub-expression of other expressions.

A noteworthy exception of the rule is references. References can extend the lifetime of temporaries, but they will be a topic of another post.

[^1]: [cppreference: lifetime](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lifetime)

In "The Design and Evolution of C++," Bjarne discussed the early design decision of the lifetime of temporaries [^2]. The book refers to an earlier paper that identified several alternative destruction points. For example, in the original CFront implementation of C++, temporaries are destroyed at the end of the blocks. This approach caused problems when creating large temporaries, and some programmers explicitly avoided the issue by wrapping statements in curly braces.

[^2]: D&E, 6.3.2

Another approach is to kill temporaries after the first use. An over-paranoid C++ programmer may suspect that the above code leads to undefined behavior. Having this thought may imply a subconscious assumption of this approach. I perceive this strategy more intuitive than the current way because of its consistency. With the current strategy, changing the above code a little bit will introduce undefined behavior:

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] auto greet(const std::string& name) -> std::string {
    return "Hello, " + name + '!';
}

int main() {
  std::string name{"Lesley Lai"};
  // highlight-start
  const char* greeting = greet(name).c_str();
  std::puts(greeting);
  // highlight-end
}
```

In the above code, the destructor of the temporary returned by `greet` gets called after evaluating the full-expression. Thus, the pointer `greeting` gets dangled. I got bite by expired temporary strings when dealing with OpenGL shaders before. Such code may even _appear_ to work for some cases [^3] because of _Small String Optimization_. Anyway, if an undefined behavior _guarantee_ to break the program in a certain way, it is no longer undefined.

[^3]: for instance, in your unit tests

Why C++ choose the current way? First, C++ cannot afford a garbage collection runtime, so "after the last usage" is out of the picture. Also, the current approach is far less error-prone to newbies than "after first use" strategy, while still performant without weird workarounds that "at the end of the block" implies.
