In the conventional wisdom of the C++ community,
non-static `const` or reference data variables are considered problematic.
Surprisingly, I cannot find a single resource dedicated to this topic.

I decide to write this post because the same problem raises several time by different people on Twitter and the [#include ï¼œ C++ï¼ž discord server](https://discord.com/invite/ZPErMGW).
There are solid reasons on why you should avoid `const` or reference member variables in C++.
Nevertheless, like many things in C++, "avoid" does not mean "never use."
And they can occasionally still find some uses.

## Const members

If you are familiar with any programming languages, such as Rust, that treat `const` as default and mutable as second class citizens, you may have the temptation to mark everything `const` if you don't need to modify them.
This practice provides a lot of benifits even in C++, as countless [Jason Turner](https://twitter.com/lefticus) and [Kate Gregory](https://twitter.com/gregcons) talks show.
Alas, in C++, every best practice has a twist, such as "`const` everything _except_ member variables."

`const` member variables disables _assignment_ and _move semantics_ for a class.
For assignments, it makes sense, since how can you assign something to a constant?
For move semantics, even though technically copy is a valid move implementation, the type system cannot guarantee that the after-move state remains the same.

"What is the big deal? I already said that I don't want to mutate the fields ever." you may ask.

Except that `swap` uses both _assignment_ and _move semantics_.
Without move operations, every move fallback to a copy.
The lack of assignment is more severe,
as it makes `swap` fail to compile:

```cpp
struct BadImmutablePoint {
    const int x = 0;
    const int y = 0;
};

int main() {
  BadImmutablePoint p1;
  BadImmutablePoint p2 {42, 55};
  std::swap(p1, p2); // Error
}
```

That also means no to all STL facilities that use assignments internally.
For example, `std::sort`:

```cpp
std::vector<BadImmutablePoint> points;
// Sort by x-axis
std::ranges::sort(points, {}, &BadImmutablePoint::x); // Error
```

## But I don't want to mutate the member variable!

The best thing you can do in C++ is to make the member variable `private` and only expose the getter.
Access control still doesn't prevent the class internals from modifying the members, but at least now everything outside the class can't.

```cpp
class ImmutablePoint {
    int x_ = 0;
    int y_ = 0;

public:
    constexpr ImmutablePoint() = default;
    constexpr ImmutablePoint(int x, int y) : x_{x}, y_{y} {}
    [[nodiscard]] constexpr auto x() const -> int { return x_; }
    [[nodiscard]] constexpr auto y() const -> int { return y_; }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<ImmutablePoint> points;
    ...
    std::ranges::sort(points, {}, &ImmutablePoint::x); // Ok
}
```

<aside style="margin-top: -60px;">

Notice that this line of sorting by getter is exactly the same as the sorting by member variable above.
C++20 ranges projection is a great feature.

</aside>

It is quite a bit of boilerplate.
And to be honest, I will stick with aggregate with none-constant fields in this particular case.
When you create a point variable, you can still mark the whole point as `const`:

```cpp
struct Point {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;
};

const Point immutable_point {42, 55};
```

If you want to get _really_ fancy, you can even create a small template to automate the process of only exposing getters.
Though I myself will certainly not go this far.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class const_wrapper {
    T val_;
public:
    constexpr const_wrapper(const T& val) : val_{val} {}
    constexpr const_wrapper(T&& val) : val_{std::move(val)} {}

    [[nodiscard]] constexpr auto get() const -> const T& { return val_; }
    [[nodiscard]] constexpr operator T() const { return val_; }
};
```

<aside style="margin-top: -210px;">

Making this `const_wrapper` class template more useful,
for example, by adding a variadic template constructor with type constraint,
is an exercise left for readers who really want to use this class ðŸ˜‰.

</aside>

Then you can use this template as following:

```cpp
struct ImmutablePoint {
    const_wrapper<int> x = 0;
    const_wrapper<int> y = 0;
};

int main() {
    std::vector<ImmutablePoint> points;
    ...
    std::ranges::sort(points, {}, &ImmutablePoint::x); // Ok
}
```

## Reference member variables

Unlike pointers or "references" in a lot of other programming languages such as Java and Python,
C++ references cannot rebind.
Hence, we have a situation very similar to `const` members.
A good analogy of references is a `const` pointer that cannot be null.
For example, the below `struct` subjects to the same problem of the `struct` with `const` fields.

```cpp
struct BadImmutableTriangle {
    const ImmutablePoint& a;
    const ImmutablePoint& b;
    const ImmutablePoint& c;
};
```

Like the solutions for const data members,
instead of storing a reference data member,
we can store a pointer member and only expose a reference getter.

```cpp
class ImmutableTriangle {
    const ImmutablePoint* a_;
    const ImmutablePoint* b_;
    const ImmutablePoint* c_;

public:
    // No default constructor
    constexpr ImmutableTriangle(
        const ImmutablePoint& a,
        const ImmutablePoint& b,
        const ImmutablePoint& c)
        : a_{&a}, b_{&b}, c_{&c} {}

    [[nodiscard]] constexpr auto a() const -> const ImmutablePoint& { return *a_; }
    [[nodiscard]] constexpr auto b() const -> const ImmutablePoint& { return *b_; }
    [[nodiscard]] constexpr auto c() const -> const ImmutablePoint& { return *c_; }
};
```

The C++ standard library ships a [`std::reference_wrapper`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/reference_wrapper) helper template and it function a lot like our `const_wrapper` above.

```cpp
struct ImmutableTriangle {
    std::reference_wrapper<const ImmutablePoint> a;
    std::reference_wrapper<const ImmutablePoint> b;
    std::reference_wrapper<const ImmutablePoint> c;
};
```

`std::reference_wrapper` is more useful than my `const_wrapper`.
As it is essential when we try to store something in the container while still maintains reference semantics:

```cpp
std::vector<ImmutablePoint&> triangles1; // Error
std::vector<std::reference_wrapper<ImmutablePoint>> triangles2; // Ok
std::vector<ImmutablePoint*> triangles3; // Okï¼Œ with caveat
```

The code `std::ranges::sort(triangles2);` sorts `triangles2` according to value comparisons.
And it will fail to compile if you haven't define relevant comparison operators.
This is the desirable behavior, as there are no clear default ordering for triangles.
On the other hand, `std::ranges::sort(triangles3)` compiles,
but it sorts by the addresses of pointers.
And this kind of nondetermistic behavior is undesirable.

## Where `const` or reference member variables can still be useful

In some cases,
you already disabled the assignment and move operations, or you need to write your own anyway.
One of the primary examples is inheritance hierarchies.
And in those cases, it is fine to use `const` or reference member variables.

Another use case of `const` or reference members is in local function objects,
where you don't care about assignment behavior.
For example, variables captured by reference in a lambda expression
are desugared into reference member variables.

## Conclusion

C++, at its core, is an imperative language built on C heritage, and `const` and references are afterthought of the language.
Also, The core language mechanisms heavily rely on assignment. Like it or not, when writing C++ classes, restricting user's freedom to mutate member variables is not well supported.
