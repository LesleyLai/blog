I read almost nothing for a few months after the lockdown, but I started to pick up reading more for the last couple of months.

- ["C++ Best Practices"](https://leanpub.com/cppbestpractices) by [Jason Turner](https://twitter.com/lefticus) — Buying Jason's book is a no-brainer for me considering I started to watch his C++ Weekly in 2016, and he was one of the people who inspired me to delve into C++ at that time. I particularly enjoy the chapter "25. Avoid default In switch Statements," which is a great practice not often mentioned, and "47. Fuzzing and Mutating," which provide concrete instructions on setting up fuzzing and mutating test.

- ["Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C Programming"](https://nostarch.com/Effective_C) by [Robert C. Seacord](https://twitter.com/RCS) — I love this book, and will recommend all C people, not just beginners, to read it. It is really easy to make mistakes when writing C code or using C APIs, and this book tries to mitigate the problem and teach best practices for writing secure C code. Since most commonly recommended C books are decades old, _Effective C_ is a rare book covering up-to-date C standards and practices. Robert certainly knows about both the standard and modern techniques very well.

- ["Elm in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action) by [Richard Feldman](https://twitter.com/rtfeldman) — This book introduces [the Elm programming language](https://elm-lang.org/) from scratch by building a simple frontend application incrementally through chapters. In each chapter, "your boss" gives you more requirements, and the book introduces language features to fulfill the requirements. Even though I used Elm to build a few games before, I still find this book enjoyable as there are many practical Jewels in this book on building production web applications. The sections about inter-oping with Javascript by [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) (instead of ports) and handling routings for single-page applications are particularly enlighting for me.

- ["Automata and Computability"](https://www.amazon.com/Automata-Computability-Undergraduate-Computer-Science/dp/0387949070#ace-g9766277718) by Dexter C. Kozen is a textbook I used in my Theory of Computation class. It is more like a course note than a traditional textbook, where topics are split into "lessons." I enjoy the writing style of this book.

- ["Analysis I: Third Edition"](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Third-Texts-Readings-Mathematics-ebook-dp-B01LFAANIW/dp/B01LFAANIW/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) by Terence Tao — this is the textbook used for our university' mathematical analysis course. It is a solid read, and the points are conveyed clearly. I also found that I am quite interested in the topic of analysis.

- ["How to Take Smart Notes"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542866502) by Sönke Ahrens: This book is recommended in the talk on "org-mode for non-programmers" by [Noorah Alhasan
  ](http://noorahalhasan.com/) in [Emscs-SF](https://www.meetup.com/Emacs-SF/) meetup.
  I am positively surprised by this book. My expectation of "self-help" books is full of platitudes with little insights. Yet this book was one of the most profound books I read this year. And I immediately put the [slip-box method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) described in the book into practice on this same book and other things I learned. The downside of this book is that it does not spend enough time on "How to take smart note," as the title suggests, but instead repeats a lot on "why." Nevertheless, these characteristics are pretty common in this kind of book.

Reread:

- ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series by Peter Shirley — I reread this series as I both covered it in the [Graphics Programming Virtual Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Graphics-Programming-Virtual-Meetup/) and did the [Ocamlpt](https://github.com/LesleyLai/ocamlpt) coding project based on the book series. In my opinion, this book is a must-read for graphics people and is also worth rereading.
- ["Quaternions for Computer Graphics"](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780857297594) by John Vince — I read it in 2016 when I understood almost nothing and wanted to make a video game, and I was lost at chapter 7. This time, I finally get enough insights into quaternions.

In progress:

- ["Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) — I joined the [programming language virtual meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Programming-Languages-Toronto-Meetup) organized by [Conor Hoekstra](https://twitter.com/code_report) this summer, and we read the classic SICP book together. We haven't finished the book yet at the time of writing.
