    <p>
      Hi, I am Lesley Lai. My primary interests include Computer Graphics and Programming Languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am pretty tech stack agnostic and finding value in working with and appreciating various
      programming languages and APIs. Some of the programming languages I like including C, C++,
      Rust, JS/TS, and OCaml.
    </p>
    <p>
      I founded <a href="https://www.meetup.com/graphics-programming-virtual-meetup/"
        >Graphics Programming Virtual Meetup</a
      > in 2020 and we continue to hold weekly meetings. In extra, I also help organizing
      <a href="https://www.includecpp.org/">{"#include <C++>"}</a>.
