Hi, I am **Lesley Lai**. My primary interests include Computer Graphics and Programming Languages.

I consider myself tech stack agnostic, appreciating and working with various programming languages and APIs. Though I do have some personal favorites. My favorite languages are C, C++, Rust, JS/TS, and OCaml. And my favorage graphics API is [Vulkan](https://vulkan.org/).

I founded [Graphics Programming Virtual Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/graphics-programming-virtual-meetup/) in 2020, and we continue to hold weekly meetings. In addition, I also contribute to the [#include <C++>](https://www.includecpp.org/) community.

Beyond math and programming, I'm a (very) amateur pianist and enjoy participating in triathlons.
