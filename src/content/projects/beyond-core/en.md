_beyond::core_ contains a bunch of utilities that are associated with graphics. It serves as a supplementary of the C++ standard library and is shared in a lot of my graphics projects. The library implements an [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system), a math library built for 3d graphics, a thread pool, and some customized containers.
