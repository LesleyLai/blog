An interactive GPU path tracer built from scratch in C++ with CUDA. It doesn't use dedicated ray tracing hardware, and instead implements all core functionality in software. The renderer includes a GPU-accelerated [BVH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy) constructed using the surface area heuristic (SAH), and a denoiser based on [Edge-Avoiding Ã€-Trous Wavelet Transform](https://jo.dreggn.org/home/2010_atrous.pdf).
