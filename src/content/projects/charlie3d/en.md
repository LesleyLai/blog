Charlie 3D is my personal R&D rendering framework built with Vulkan. It supports features like shader hot reloading, PBR shading, shadow mapping, and GLTF loading. I'm developing it with a focus on modern Vulkan features, including dynamic rendering, descriptor indexing, and buffer device addressing.
