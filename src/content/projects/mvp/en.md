The _MVP (minimal visual pedagogical) interpreter_ is a substitution-based interpreter on a toy language.
My goal is to demonstrate small-step [operational semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_semantics) of programming languages visually for students new to this concept.
The project supports single stepping forward/backward for the program execution and visualizes the AST at each step.
